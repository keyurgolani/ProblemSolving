Problem Statement
You are given two s: N and K. Lun the dog is interested in strings that satisfy the following conditions:

The string has exactly N characters, each of which is either 'A' or 'B'.
The string s has exactly K pairs (i, j) (0 <= i < j <= N-1) such that s[i] = 'A' and s[j] = 'B'.
If there exists a string that satisfies the conditions, find and return any such string. Otherwise, return an empty string.

Examples
0)
3
2
Returns: "ABB"
This string has exactly two pairs (i, j) mentioned in the statement: (0, 1) and (0, 2).
1)
2
0
Returns: "BA"
Please note that there are valid test cases with K = 0.
2)
5
8
Returns: ""
Five characters is too short for this value of K.
3)
10
12
Returns: "BAABBABAAB"
Please note that this is an example of a solution; other valid solutions will also be accepted.
