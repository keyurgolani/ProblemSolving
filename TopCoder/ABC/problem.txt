Problem Statement

You are given two ints: N and K. Lun the dog is interested in strings that satisfy the following conditions:

The string has exactly N characters, each of which is either 'A', 'B' or 'C'.
The string s has exactly K pairs (i, j) (0 <= i < j <= N-1) such that s[i] < s[j].
If there exists a string that satisfies the conditions, find and return any such string. Otherwise, return an empty string.


Definition

Class:	ABC
Method:	createString
Parameters:	int, int
Returns:	String
Method signature:	String createString(int N, int K)
(be sure your method is public)


Constraints
-	N will be between 3 and 30, inclusive.
-	K will be between 0 and N(N-1)/2, inclusive.

Examples
0)

3
3
Returns: "ABC"
This string has exactly three pairs (i, j) mentioned in the statement: (0, 1), (0, 2) and (1, 2).
1)

3
0
Returns: "CBA"
Please note that there are valid test cases with K = 0.
2)

5
10
Returns: ""
Five characters is too short for this value of K.
3)

15
36
Returns: "CABBACCBAABCBBB"
Please note that this is an example of a solution; other valid solutions will also be accepted.
